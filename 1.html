        <h1># Making a folder and a README file in Linux.</h1>
        <p>> mkdir Project</p>
        <p class="comment"># mkdir creates a folder. Its first argument gives the folder a name, and is required.</p>

        <p>> cd Project</p>
        <p class="comment"># cd stands for "change directory". Folders are generally equivalents of directories. The first argument is the directory that it changes to. To change the directory to a parent, use "..". If you want to describe the children folder  of the folder to go to, use /'s (e.g. cd folder/childfolder). </p>

       <div id="1" class="hidden">
       	<p>> touch README.txt</p>
	<p class="comment"># The touch command creates a file. Its argument determines the name and the filetype of the resulting file.</p>

       </div>
       <div id="2" class="hidden">
	<p>> echo "This is a readme file." >> README.txt</p>
	<p class="comment"># The echo command writes the first argument into something. It usually writes into the terminal. However, if arrows are used, it will write down the first argument into the file the arrows are pointing to. If the file referred to by the arrows doesn't exist, then it  will be made with the first argument written into it.</p>

       <div id="3" class="hidden">
       	<p>> cat README.md</p>
	<p class="return">This is a readme file.</p>
	<p class="comment"># cat writes the contents of the file referred to in the first argument right into the terminal. This concludes our first tutorial.</p>
